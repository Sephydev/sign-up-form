# Sign-up Form

This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum.
It consist of using what we learned during the Intermediate HTML & CSS module to do a sign-up form based on a design given by TOP.

A [Live Demo](https://sephydev.github.io/sign-up-form/) is available.

## What was the most easy part ?

The most easy part was doing the basic HTML skeleton for the project.

## What was the hardest part ?

The hardest part was organizing the HTML in order to style it with CSS to make the styling more easy.
The Regular Expression for the password pattern was also really hard to do. To help me I found a regular expression for password on Google then I adapted it.

## Design

Here you can see the design provided by The Odin Project.
